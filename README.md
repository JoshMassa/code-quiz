# Code Quiz

## Overview
I created this code quiz to showcase my development with JavaScript. This project helped me further my skills with writing functions as well as using different JavaScript methods. More than 60% of the code to run this game is executed through JavaScript.

## Features

1. Responsive Design

I designed my webpage to be fully responsive from the smallest mobile devices, to tablets, to the largest desktops to provide a consistent means to view my code quiz in an enjoyable and engaging experience.

2. Navigation Menu

At the top left of the page, you will see the text "View High Scores". When clicked on, this will navigate you to the Leaderboard that displays your locally stored scores.

3. Timer

At the top right of the page, you will notice a timer indicated by the text "Time Remaining: 60 seconds". Please refer to quiz intructions for further information.

4. Quiz Instructions

In the center of the page, you will see a welcome message, followed by the instructions for how the quiz works. You will start with 60 seconds on your timer, that will decrement by 1 second with each second that passes, or by 10 seconds each time you answer a question incorrectly. Your score is based on your time remaining after answering all of the questions (or once the timer reaches 0). The faster you answer all the questions correctly, the higher your score.

5. Technologies Used
